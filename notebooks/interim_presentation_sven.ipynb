    "- several pre-build models $\\rightarrow$ use only, say, top kaggle performer?\n",
    "  - top predictor not top fair...\n",
    "- in total 20 covariats, would focus on gender, age, foreign_worker\n",
    "  - but still the others could be included/excluded $\\rightarrow$lot of combinations\n",
